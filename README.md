# AI & Real Image Detector (DeepFake Classifier)

A web-based **image classification tool** built with **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit** to detect whether an image is **REAL** or **AI-generated (DeepFake)**. This application uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze and classify images with high accuracy.


## 🚀 Features

- **Upload and Analyze Images**: Upload an image and instantly get predictions.
- **Fast & Accurate**: Detects AI-generated images (DeepFakes) with high confidence.
- **Web Interface**: Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
- **AI-Powered**: Built on a TensorFlow model for accurate results.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning library for model training and inference.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for creating data apps.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing in Python.
- **Pillow**: For image processing and manipulation.
